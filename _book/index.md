# About  

Welcome to this **econometrics study guide**, a resource designed to support undergraduate students in their journey to understanding econometrics. These personal notes are based on lectures attended at **Universidad Panamericana**, alongside additional materials such as lecture notes, websites, books, and other sources.  

While this guide is crafted to offer a quick and accessible approach to the subject, it is strongly recommended that students consult the original resources for a more comprehensive understanding.  

## Purpose  

This site serves as a developing repository of knowledge, aimed at supplementing students' studies. Please note that the material is continually updated, so your patience is appreciated as we work on corrections and add new content.  

## Feedback  

Your input is valuable! If you have comments, recommendations, or corrections, please reach out to us at **0251520@up.edu.mx**. We aim to address feedback and update the content promptly.
