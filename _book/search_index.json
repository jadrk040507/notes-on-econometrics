These personal notes are based on lectures attended at Universidad Panamericana, alongside additional materials such as lecture notes, websites, books, and other sources. While this guide is crafted to offer a quick and accessible approach to the subject, it is strongly recommended that students consult the original resources for a more comprehensive understanding. 1.1 Purpose This site serves as a developing repository of knowledge, aimed at supplementing students’ studies. Please note that the material is continually updated, so your patience is appreciated as we work on corrections and add new content. 1.2 Feedback Your input is valuable! If you have comments, recommendations, or corrections, please reach out to us at 0251520@up.edu.mx. We aim to address feedback and update the content promptly. 1.3 Support If you find this project helpful and wish to support it, you can make a donation at buymeacoffee.com/jadrk040507.

There should be only one first-level heading (#) per .Rmd file. 2.1 A section All chapter sections start with a second-level (##) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter. An unnumbered section Chapters and sections are numbered by default.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 3. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.

Unfortunately, if you choose a different basis for \\(V\\), the matrix representing the linear transformation \\(T\\) will be quite different from the original matrix \\(A\\). This section’s goal is to find out a clean criterion for when two matrices actually represent the same linear transformation but under different choice of bases. Two \\(n \\times n\\) matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are similar if there is and invertible matrix \\(C\\) such that \\[ A = C^{-1}BC \\] We want to see that two matrices are similar precisely when they represent the same linear transformation. Choose two bases for the vector space \\(V\\), say \\({v_1, \\ldots, v_n}\\) (the \\(v\\) basis) and \\({w_1, \\ldots, w_n}\\) (the \\(w\\) basis). Let \\(A\\) be the matrix representing the linear transformation \\(T\\) for the basis and let \\(B\\) be the matrix representing the linear transformation for the \\(w\\) basis. We want to construct the matrix \\(C\\) so that \\(A = C^{-1}BC\\). Recall that given the \\(v\\) basis, we can write each vector \\(z \\in V\\) as an \\(n \\times 1\\) column vector as follows: we know that there are unique scalars \\(a_1, \\ldots, a_n\\) with \\[ z = a_1 v_1 + \\dots + a_n v_n \\] We then write \\(z\\), with respect to the \\(v\\) basis, as the column vector: \\[ \\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a_n \\end{pmatrix} \\] Similarily, then are unique scalars \\(w_1, \\dots, w_n\\) so that \\[ z = b_1 w_1 + \\dots + b_n w_n, \\] meaning that with respect to the \\(w\\) basis, the vector \\(z\\) is the column vector: \\[ \\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ b_n \\end{pmatrix} \\] The desired matrix \\(C\\) will be the matrix such that \\[ C \\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a_n \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ b_n \\end{pmatrix}. \\] If \\(C = (c_{ij})\\), then the entries \\(c_{ij}\\) are precisely the numbers which yield: \\[ w_i = c_{i1} v_1 + \\dots + c_{in} v_n. \\] To commute, meaning that \\(CA = BC\\) or \\[ A = C^{-1}BC, \\] as desired. Determining two matrices are similar is a type of result that shows throughout math and physics. Regularly you must choose some coordinate system (some basis) in order to write down anything at all, but the underlying math or physics that you are interested in is independent of the initial choice. The key question becomes: what is preserved when the coordinate system is changed? Similar matrices allow us to understand these questions. 8.2 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
